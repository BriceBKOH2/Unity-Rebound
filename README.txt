To launch the game use Rebound.exe, works better in windows mode in this current version, buttons doesnt work for now

TO DO LIST
- Fix the replay bug, its either a button problem or more likely a SceneManager problem
- Clearer bondaries or remove kill on hit from borderwall
- Change the "boing" sound to something better than the default sound effect
- Either redesign or ajust camera, possible idea is to add option to fix camera to the ball.

- Better graphic : Plateform first, adding effects to collision, animation on launch and death, ...
