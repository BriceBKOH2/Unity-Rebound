To launch the game use Rebound.exe, works better in windows mode in this current version, buttons doesnt work for now
image added in root folder from in game capture

TO DO LIST
- All scripts are unlinked to all object, apparently unity say the doesnt compile, but did previously and nothing seems wrong code wise, importing the project and updating it to current Unity version caused the problem (also reinstallied unity, maybe its an option problem)
- Fix the replay bug, its either a button problem or more likely a SceneManager problem
- Clearer bondaries or remove kill on hit from borderwall
- Change the "boing" sound to something better than the default sound effect
- Either redesign or ajust camera, possible idea is to add option to fix camera to the ball.

- Better graphic : Plateform first, adding effects to collision, animation on launch and death, ...
